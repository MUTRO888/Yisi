## 📖 Core Philosophy

Yisi fundamentally breaks the traditional AI interaction relationship. **Yisi has no chatbox.**

It’s not "select content → open chat → describe request → wait for reply." It’s simply "select → present." There is no back-and-forth, no Q&A, and no conversational relationship to maintain. You aren’t chatting with an AI—you are just doing what you were meant to do. The AI silently completes the conversion and disappears.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Translation, Elevated
The exact moment most people need translation is the moment they get interrupted. With Yisi, simply select text, press a shortcut, and the result emerges right there in place. No page jumping, no context switching.
- **Authentic Translations:** Built-in polished translation prompts produce highly readable, natural language, unlike mechanical word-for-word generation.
- **Learned Rules:** Whenever you correct a term or modify a tone, Yisi remembers and automatically applies it going forward.
- **Offline Support:** Built with macOS native System Translation to work securely even without an internet connection.

### 2. Beyond Translation
Code needs explaining. Drafts need polishing. Error screenshots need fixing. Yisi makes this flow smoothly via two modes:
- **Preset Mode:** Predefine your scenario (e.g., input perception + output command). Configure once, use forever. Your intent is concretized in the configuration, making the AI a smooth extension of your workflow.
- **Custom Mode:** For one-off needs. Trigger the prompt, tell Yisi exactly what the content is and what to do, and have it handled immediately. 

### 3. Vision as Input
When your question is tucked in an image (a design draft, a chart, or an error log), Yisi understands it just the same. 
Use the screenshot shortcut to crop any area on your screen, and the Preset or Custom mode will analyze the visual data silently.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Convert in three simple steps:**
1. **Select**: Highlight text in any app, or use the screenshot shortcut to crop an area.
2. **Trigger**: `Cmd + C + C` (Text) / `Cmd + Shift + X` (Screenshot)
3. **Present**: Results appear instantly in a unified popup. Close it to return exactly where you left off.
*(Shortcuts can be customized in Settings → General)*

**5-Minute Setup:**
Yisi supports Gemini, OpenAI, and Zhipu AI natively. We recommend starting with Zhipu AI for an effortless kickoff.
1. Visit the [Zhipu AI Developer Platform](https://open.bigmodel.cn) to register and grab an API Key.
2. Open Yisi → Settings → AI Services.
3. Select "Zhipu AI" as your provider and paste the API Key.
4. The models are pre-configured. Use it out-of-the-box or change as necessary.
5. All done! Ready to enjoy seamless conversions.
